There's this great mobile application I use all the time called [CamScanner](https://www.camscanner.com). It lets you take a picture of a writing surface (such as a sheet of paper or a whiteboard), and it automatically (with a bit of non-automatic assistance) crops, un-distorts, color-corrects, and stores the resulting image. It's super easy to use and great for making PDFs of various handouts.

The Kokuyo CamiApp notebook isn't an app, it's a notebook. But it does have an app companion that works okay enough if you feel like making it your number one.

It's a twin ring bound notebook, which is kind of like your normal spiralbound but each loop has its own dedicated two rings rather than one wire that spirals throughout. Apparently this helps with longevity. 

If you look closely above, you'll notice that the rings aren't perfect circles, but rather slanted at some points. I've had binders with similar designs, it helps with turning pages. Binders usually carry rather large sheets of paper though; I'm not so sure it equally benefits this A6 (105 x 148 mm, 4.1 x 5.8 in) notebook.

The notebook has a thick cardboard cover. The front of the cover has this grainy texture appearance, but it feels relatively smooth. I can see it bending (particularly the corners) if you're rather rough, but it's better than a standard softcover notebook.

The first sheet of the notebook has instructions on how to use the notebook and its companion app. Or at least I assume it does given the pictures, I certainly can't read the Japanese. It also has a spot to mark the meanings of your markers, more on that later.

First of all, my Lamy Vista actually has a Fine nib, not a medium. Sorry for the mix-up.

Anyway, my particular 50-sheet notebook has a standard 5mm graph ruling. You can also get this notebook in 6mm lined if that's what you like.

On first glance this ink handles pretty well, no outstanding feathering. You might be able to notice that Kon-Peki is not as shad-y as it usually is though. Apparently I've forgotten to take a picture of the backside, but the paper is quite absorbent and there are specks of bleedthrough scattered behind the fountain pen inks (especially out of the wider nibs and Baystate Blue). It's not horrible but it's disappointing. I quite like Kokuyo notebooks in general (I use their Todai notebooks all the time) but it seems like their paper is more inconsistent than the other Japanese branches (Apica, LIFE, Maruman). 

The pages in the notebook are actually micro-perforated, which means you can tear them out easily, a rarity in many of the Japanese notebooks I've used. There's a catch though that I'll mention later.

This closer look really demonstrates the lack of feathering (except for the little with BSB, but really, that even feathers on Rhodia), so if you're OK with the subpar bleedthrough performance you'll be pleased with this paper.

You'll also notice the large subdivided square in the corner. You're supposed to use that to "mark" the pages, sort of like a tag. By filling in (or not) the rectangles you can create 8 distinct tags. But what are the tags for? Well that's where the app comes in.

Kokuyo's CamiApp is available on iOS and Android devices (sorry WP users, as a former holder I can empathize with all 12 of you). It lets you take a picture of a page in your CamiApp notebook and then automatically act upon it according to the tag you've made physically on the page. As you can see above, you can have it publish your picture to a wide variety of file-storage services, as well as digitally tag them for organization within the application. Sharing to Dropbox worked fine for me, you can even have it save the image as a PDF instead of a JPEG.

The camera built into the app has a set of orange guides that you're supposed to align to the black borders of the notebook. This is important, as it means that you can't tear out a page and scan it later. Well, you probably can, but I imagine the app's cropping system is built around the black border, so you might get subpar results if you do otherwise. You also need to specify which notebook variant you have. This is curious as JetPens, the retailer I purchased this notebook at, only offers the notebook in A6, as well as notepad in A7, but the app lists tons of size variants. I guess those are Japan-only.

From the picture on the right you can see the app doesn't do much processing beyond cropping your image. No color adjustment, noise removal, or automatic contrast here. You can add a title to the image to keep track of it within the app.

Really though, I have no use for the in-app organization features, and while nifty, my phone already syncs all of my photos to Dropbox, so that's pretty much moot as well. And with the actual picture processing being much much weaker than what CamScanner provides (and with CamScanner working with ANY notebook), the notebook's app integration is pretty much useless to me.

So why else use the notebook? Well, it's a small little hardcover ring-bound notebook. That's like the exact opposite of what I want out of a pocket notebook but I'm sure some people will like it! Plus, if you don't use fountain pens (or don't care about bleedthrough) the paper's quite nice---smooth, white, and perforated. I could totally see someone using this notebook while completely ignoring the digital integration. 

If you wish to give it a try, I bought mine over at [JetPens](http://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-CamiApp-Twin-Ring-Notebooks/ct/1613) for $4.45. It's a bit expensive, but I assume the price factors in the app integration as the app itself is free.
