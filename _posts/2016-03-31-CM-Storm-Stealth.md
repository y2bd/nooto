description: A review of the Cooler Master Quickfire Stealth keyboard with Cherry MX Red switches.

I've been spending way too much time over on [/r/mechmarket](//reddit.com/r/mechmarket) recently for my own good. I rarely buy anything, it's just fun to look. However, when I saw someone selling their Quickfire Stealth with Cherry MX Reds for $45, I really couldn't pass it up. Not only did I already have some knowledge of the goodness of CM's boards (thanks to my CM Rapid-i with Browns, review in the future!), but I hadn't had any boards with linear switches yet, something I definitely want to try for myself, both for the "gaming" that it's so touted for, as well as for general usage as a light switch. And oh boy are they light.

This is a tenkeyless board, which means that it drops only the numpad (unlike my 60% Pok3r). Although you can't really tell due to the blank keycaps, it features a bunch of function keys to handle things like media keys that might have been dedicated keys in a full-size board. It also does the Cooler Master thing of letting you quickly change the repeat rate, which I still haven't found a use for.

The board itself carries some heft--apparently it has steel reinforcements inside (I wouldn't know, I haven't opened it up). Trying to flex it as hard as I can causes some unpleasant plastic creaking, so I don't recommend flexing it for no reason!

The whole board is coated in this rubbery finish. It feels awesome to the touch and looks beautifully matte. However, hand oils absolutely love to cling to it. I've read that dust and other particles like to cling to it as well, so make sure to practice proper keyboard hygiene.
